## Pandas-challenge
- As a position of new Cheif Data Scientist for Citys School District, I have to complie a series of report to sturcture future school budgetes and prioriteies as described in Module 4 Challenge.pdf.
- You will find my final report in PyCity School Analysisfinal.docx  or PyCityAnalysis.md



   * In this repository you will find under resources folder two sets of csv raw data file derived from the School Distirct which are going to be under my analysis.
   * Folder PyCitySchools you will find the code which I have derived from many sources to help navigate to our requirments.
   * A File name Module 4 in a PDF format will be attached for more detail instruction on specific data that need to be calculated. 

    * The task on hand given to me are :

     # 1) Create a District Summary
                Total Number of unique Schools
                Total Sutdents
                Total Budget
                Average Math Score
                Average Reading Score
                % Passing Math 
                % Passing Reading 
                % Overall Passing

    # 2) School Summary
                Create a DataFrame which will Summarize:

                Total Students
                Total School Budget
                Per Student Budget
                Average Math Score
                Average REading Score
                % Passing Math with >70%
                % Passing Englisth with >70%
                % Over all passing

     # 3) Highets Performing Schools (by % Overall pass)  
                Sort School by % Overall passing

    # 4) Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall pass)
                Sort School by % Overall passing

     # 5) Math Score By Grade
                Create DataFrame
                list average Math Score for each grade(9-12) at each school.

                list Average Reading Score for each grade (9-12) at each school.

    # 6) Scores by School Spending 

                Create a Table of school Performance based on Scores spending averages (Per student)

                In the Table have:
                Average Math Score
                Average Reading Score
                % Passing math (70 or >)
                % Passing reading  (70 or >)
                % Over All Passing
