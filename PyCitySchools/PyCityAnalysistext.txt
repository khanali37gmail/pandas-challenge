PyCity School Analysis

This report has been generated based on the data collected from Schools_complete.csv and Students_complete.csv 
My Analysis are as follows:
The analysis indicated that Charter schools outperform District School in terms of average math and reading score, as well as the percentage of student passing both subjects. (refer to Data 1)
The analysis also suggests that contrary to expectation higher per student spending in district school does not consistently lead to better academic outcomes. (refer to Data 2)

Scores By School Type Summary

Charter schools demonstrate significantly higher average scores in both math and reading compared to district schools. Moreover, charter schools exhibit notably higher percentages of students passing both math and reading assessments, resulting in a substantially higher overall passing percentage. This suggests a potential difference in educational approaches and outcomes between charter and district schools.

school type 	Average Math Score	Average Reading Score	% Passing Math	% Passing Reading	% Overall Passing
charter	83.47385187	83.89642074	93.62083004	96.58648927	90.43224369

Scores by School Size Summary 

•	Charter schools, on average, outperform district schools in both math and reading scores, as well as in the percentage of students passing both subjects.
•	Charter schools exhibit higher overall passing percentages, indicating a better overall academic performance.
•	District schools have larger student populations, but this does not consistently translate to higher academic achievement.
•	Smaller and medium-sized schools (both charter and district) tend to have higher overall passing percentages.







Scores by School Spending
1.	<$585:
•	Charter schools with lower per-student budgets demonstrate strong academic performance across all metrics.
2.	$585-630:
•	Both charter and district schools fall into this range, with varied performance.
•	Charter schools tend to have higher average scores and passing percentages.
3.	$630-645:
•	District schools in this range show moderate academic performance.
•	Charter schools exhibit higher average scores and passing percentages.
4.	$645-680:
•	District schools in this range have lower passing percentages.
•	Charter schools maintain higher academic performance.


In conclusion, this analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing academic performance in PyCity schools. It emphasizes the need for a nuanced approach to education, considering not only budget allocations but also the effectiveness of different school types and sizes.
